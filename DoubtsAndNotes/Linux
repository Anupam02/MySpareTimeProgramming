while making any script executable in the current directory , you can add the
current working directory to the path by PATH=PATH:.  , or execute it by
./script  , ./ is for specifying the current directory.

Specifying the path prepended with ./ does have one other advantage: It ensures
that you don't accidentally execute another command on the system with the same
name as your script file.

    ** You shouldn't change the PATH variable like this for the superuser, 
    conventionally the user name root.It's a security loophole, because the 
    system administrator logged in as root can be tricked into invoking a fake
    version of a standard command.One of the authors admits to this once --
    just to prove a point to the system administrator about security, of course!    It's only a slight risk on ordinary accounts to include the current 
    directory in the path, so if you are particularly concerned , just get into
    the habit of prepending  ./ to all commands that are in the local directory.
