what is the concept of buffers in programming specially in C and C++ , have a look at program IntChar.cpp, and have a look at getchar() function.
for eg consider following example in c.
int c;

while( c = getchar() and c != '\n')
putchar(c)


after reading a complete line it prints the putchar from starting of the buffer, what is the while loop doing here?
