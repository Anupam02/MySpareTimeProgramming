    I was just thinking about the concept of variables and their values , and
    thinking that suppose we named a chunk of bits to variable name to store 
    the value of that type.
    let its name is myvariable of type int, then computer finds a memory
    location for storing 4bytes of int, and that can be accessed using name
    myvariable.and that location can be accessed by address of operator (& in 
    C or C++. 
    So initially my confusion was that myvariable also gets stored on some
    other memory location, and my doubt was that whether it is character or
    what , but as my doubt was based on a wrong concept, I concluded that 
    the variable name myvariable itself acts as a random access for that
    variable value.
