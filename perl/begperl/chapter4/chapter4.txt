handling access of keys which are not present
    this is checked by a condition (not exists $rates{$to}), die is a way of
    making Perl print out an error message and finish the program. It also 
    reports to the operating system - Windows, Unix, Linux or whatever it
    may be, that the program finished with an error.(like in my linux it 
    is 255 ,which is exit status, 0 is for successful program execution in linux) 

What is false? in perl
    * An empty string, "", is false.
    * The number zero and the string "0" are both false.
    * An empty list , (), is false.
    * The undefined value is false.
    * Everything else is true.

statement modifiers
    * this happens if this doesn't exists,{ print "you rock " if $a == 5 ; 
    * this happens unless this exists.
    * this happens with for too , $total += $_ for (@ARGV);
    * this happens with while too , $countdown = 5, print "Counting down: $countdown\n" while $countdown-- ;

if oppositie unless,
while opposite until,
keyword last is equivalent to break in perl
keyword next is equivalent to continue in perl
