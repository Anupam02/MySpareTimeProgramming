    # The perl interprets numbers and strings on an equal footing,and where
    # necessary, perl converts between strings, integers, and floating-point
    # numbers behind the scenes.
    # "0.25"*4 = 1 , perl treats it as a number and gives you the expected answer 1.
    #
    # Binary, hex, and octal numbers are an exception though
