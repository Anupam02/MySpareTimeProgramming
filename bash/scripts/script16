# Reading User Input
echo -n "Please enter the new position: "

read POSITION
# Note how the prompt message has a colon to help signify the computer awaits the user's input.The prompt also ends with a space to seperate the user's input from the prompt.This is a common technique
 
echo
# this echo has no argument , so this echo command just prints out a new line.

echo "Congratulations, $POSITION!"
